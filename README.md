We are honestly trying to find some way towards a sustainable, healthy lifestyle. Whatever that means. We want to be reasonably healthy when we get old and the last few years it’s dawned on us that we really ought to get started now if we want to have any hope in the future. You are not obsessive about it. You don’t want to be buff and bronzed. You just don't want to have diabetes and multiple heart attacks by the time you are 45. Not an insurmountable goal.
